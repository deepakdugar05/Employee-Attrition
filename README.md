 Employee Attrition
 Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction using IBM HR Analytics Dataset  This project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python, I examine key factors that may contribute to employee turnover and performance. By identifying patterns and trends, the goal is to provide insights into how organizations can manage attrition more effectively.\
 Project Highlights - *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* A detailed investigation into the dataset to understand the relationships between features such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, age, salary, etc., and employee attrition. 
*Data Visualization:* Charts and plots to visualize key patterns and trends. 
*Statistical Analysis:* To identify significant factors affecting employee attrition. 
*Machine Learning Models:* Using various machine learning algorithms to predict whether an employee will leave the company based on historical data.  
Tech Stack - *Programming Language:* Python - *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn - *Machine Learning Algorithms:* Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.  

This project can be a useful tool for HR professionals seeking to gain insights into employee attrition and make data-driven decisions to retain top talent.
